RogueWorld is a college project, with the goal to create a multiplayer Roguelike world.


= Details =

== Initial Phase (basic structure) ==
In the initial phase, the goal is to get a simple, working base.

The following aims exist:
  * A *persistent*, *real-time* world server
  * Basic support for rooms, players and objects
  * An UDP-safe communication [ProtocolSpecification] (currently just over TCP)

The intial phase is complete. Revision 38 marks its end, in the Subversion repository.

== Second Phase (network structure) ==
The second phase aims to finalize a good network base, as much of the later code will depend on how it is implemented.

The following aims exist:
  * Switch to full UDP support
  * Full support for resending/confirming of packets in the [ProtocolSpecification]
  * A better and more generalized implementation of the protocol
