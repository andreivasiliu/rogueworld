#summary Communication protocol used between RogueWorld clients and the server.

= Design Goals =

Even though initially tested over TCP, the intent is to provide a fast, safe protocol for use with UDP. Packets must be small and error-safe, and subsequent information about an object or aspect of the game should make all previous packets obsolete. The goal is to support a packet loss rate of at least 5-10%.

*Status*: _Partially Planned_.

= High-Level Specification =

Login Protocol:
  * Client:
    * send 'login user, password'
  * Server:
    * send 'userinfo real_name, position'
    * send 'map'
  * Client:
    * send 'enterworld'

= Low-Level Specification =

Global Pachet Header:
 `<int32><int32><int32>`
 ` ^      ^      ^-- message ID`
 ` |      \-- message number`
 ` \-- message length`

Login Pachet (oid = MSG_LOGIN):
 `<string>`
 ` ^-- name`
